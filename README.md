- To change the brightness of fonts in CSS, I found this blog from [Chris Strahl]("https://weblog.west-wind.com/posts/2020/Jul/28/Using-the-brightness-CSS-Filter-to-generically-highlight-Content")
- For stylistic representatio I was aiming for a combination between [Harry Styles](https://hstyles.co.uk/) and [Half Moon Run](https://www.halfmoonrun.com/).
