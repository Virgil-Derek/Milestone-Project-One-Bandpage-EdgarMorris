## Deployment

  a. Bugs: 
      1. When trying to upload my cover Image, remained Black, no image showed. 
              Solution: checked filepath. it had: url:(..assets/images/image.jpg) it should have been: url: ("../images/image.jpg")
      2. When using hamburger drowpdown menu, There was no response. after looking through a number of online solutions. It was the missing script from bootstrap. (Ps: In 5.0 version documentation no it said no scripts where necessary to include + there seems to be no documentation about a hamburger dropdown on bootstrap, neither version 4.1 or 5.0?)
      3. Validator [Jigsaw for CSS](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fvirgil-derek.github.io%2FMilestone-Project-One-Bandpage-EdgarMorris%2F&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=nl) 
        17 bugs. all with CDN javascript. up to this point no idea what the exact problem is. Perhaps newest version 5.0 instead of 4.1 version.
